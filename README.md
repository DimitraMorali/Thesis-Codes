R codes used in my thesis with title "Bayesian Non Parametric Inference on Stochastic Dynamical Systems", for the master's degree in Statistics and Data Analysis.
Specifically,
"GMM" contains the code to estimate the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model based on Gibbs sampling algorithm (chapter 2).

"DPMM" contains the code based on Walker's algorithm to sample the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for density estimation purposes(chapter 3).

"DPR" contains the code for the Dirichlet Process Reconstruction model to estimate the parameters of stochastic dynamical systems (chapter 4).
